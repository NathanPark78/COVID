# COVID

This is my final project for the second-level MATLAB course through Coursicle/Vanderbilt University, Mastering Programming For MATLAB! The following project is capable of analyzing and displaying the imported dataset of COVID-19 data. Displaying COVID cases, both cases and deaths, in all available locations within the data set. The control panel on the app itself has the capability of the user choosing country/state, whether to display the cases and death options, a cumulative or daily count, and a rounding function for the daily count display from 1 to 15 days. 

This was a great project that tested the MATLAB skills I've learned in this course and I cannot wait to apply it more throughout my academia and my career!
